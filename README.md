# path_smooth_with_kappa


This is used for smoothing path. SQP optimization model is established in Cartesian coordinate system.

In this repo, Î¸ is the bias between the angle of reference point and decision variable. k is the curvature. In this model, speed is considered as an constant value, is therefore replaced by a constant distance ds.

In the kinematic model constrians, Taylor expansion is used based on reference points. 

As shown in figure below, SQP is the smoothing result, where IHA* represents the original path.
